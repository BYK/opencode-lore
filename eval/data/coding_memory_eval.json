    "answer": "The gradient context manager was using a hardcoded overhead estimate (FIRST_TURN_OVERHEAD = 15000) instead of calibrating against actual token usage. The fix was to add EMA-based calibration using real input token counts from message.updated events.",

    "answer": "OpenCode's build-switch.txt contains literal <system-reminder> tags that leak into the nuum gradient raw window. Layer 4's stripToTextOnly didn't apply cleanParts, so these tags survived stripping. The fix was committed as c054f64.",

Root cause: pagination_cursors table had single-column PK (command_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY) but code expected composite PK [command_key, context] — schema drift from an older build.",
