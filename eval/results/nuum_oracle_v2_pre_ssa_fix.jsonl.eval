Timing alone is unreliable.\n- For cashew yogurt: soak cashews at least 4-6 hours (overnight is better), blend until very smooth, and strain through a nut milk bag rather than cheesecloth — finer mesh gives a creamier result.\n\n**General slow cooker tips:**\n- Avoid lifting the lid frequently — each peek adds 15-30 minutes to cook time.\n- Low and slow is usually better than high and fast for texture.\n\nCould you share more about what specific problems you're running into? \"Struggling\" could mean many things — texture issues, timing, flavor — and I can give more precise advice with that context.","label":true,"judge_response":"Yes"}

They might not prefer general tips on buying an electric guitar or suggestions that do not take into account their current guitar and desired upgrade.","hypothesis":"Based on your previous interests, here are focused tips for your music store visit:\n\n**Since you're considering a Les Paul upgrade from your Strat:**\n\n- **Coil-tap/coil-splitting** — You specifically flagged this as important for tonal flexibility, especially for open D tuning. Make sure to test this feature on any Les Paul you try.\n- **Playability for fingerpicking** — You're interested in fingerpicking styles (like \"Blackbird\"), so pay attention to neck profile and string action, which differ significantly from your Strat.\n- **Humbucker tone** — Play around with the pickups and compare to your Strat's single-coil sound to make sure the warmer, thicker Les Paul tone suits your style.\n- **Try it in open D** — If possible, ask the staff to tune one to open D so you can hear how it sounds for your intended use.\n\nThe coil-tap feature in particular seems like a priority for you given your interest in versatility across fingerpicking and open tuning styles.","label":true,"judge_response":"Yes"}

I don't know your timeline or financial situation.\n\nWhat I can say from your context: your use case (central backup for laptop and phone, security features like encryption and access control) is well-served by current NAS options, so there's no strong technical reason to wait. If your storage issues are pressing now, buying now is reasonable. If budget is tight, waiting for sales (e.g. mid-year or holiday deals) could make sense.","label":true,"judge_response":"yes"}
